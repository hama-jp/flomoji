# TypeScript Migration Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the TypeScript migration performed on the Flomoji project to improve type safety and maintainability.

## Migration Scope

### Completed Migrations

#### 1. Core Services (✅ Complete)
- **storageService.js → storageService.ts**
  - Added type safety for all storage operations
  - Fixed localStorage availability checks for Node.js test environment
  - Implemented generic type parameters for get/set operations

- **llmService.js → llmService.ts**
  - Created comprehensive provider configuration types
  - Added LLMSettings and LLMMessage interfaces
  - Implemented type-safe API request/response handling
  - Removed debug console.log statements

- **logService.js → logService.ts**
  - Added type definitions for log entries and run records
  - Implemented IndexedDB type safety
  - Created interfaces for database operations

- **apiKeysService.js → apiKeysService.ts**
  - Simple migration with string key-value type safety
  - Leveraged updated storageService types

#### 2. State Management (✅ Complete)
- **store/index.js → store/index.ts**
  - Migrated Zustand store to TypeScript
  - Created interfaces for UI, Workflow, and Execution state slices
  - Added type-safe selectors and action hooks

- **store/workflowStore.js → store/workflowStore.ts**
  - Implemented WorkflowState interface
  - Added type safety for React Flow nodes and edges
  - Created typed action methods

#### 3. Type Definitions (✅ New)
- **types/index.ts**
  - Central location for all shared type definitions
  - Organized by domain: nodes, workflows, execution, services
  - Includes comprehensive JSDoc documentation

## Key Changes

### 1. Import Statement Organization
Using ESLint with eslint-plugin-import to enforce consistent import ordering:
- Built-in modules
- External libraries
- Internal modules
- Relative imports
- Type imports

### 2. Browser vs Node.js Environment Handling
```typescript
// Before (caused test failures)
const item = localStorage.getItem(key);

// After (works in both environments)
if (typeof localStorage === 'undefined') {
  return defaultValue;
}
const item = localStorage.getItem(key);
```

### 3. Type Safety Improvements
- Eliminated `any` types where possible
- Added generic type parameters for flexibility
- Created specific interfaces for all data structures
- Implemented error classes with proper typing

## Testing
All TypeScript changes have been validated with:
- ✅ 65/65 unit tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compiler checks (no errors)
- ✅ ESLint validation
- ✅ Runtime testing with pnpm dev

## CI/CD Integration
Added GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:
- Runs TypeScript type checking on every push
- Validates ESLint rules
- Executes full test suite
- Ensures code quality standards

## Remaining JavaScript Files
The following files remain in JavaScript and can be migrated in future iterations:
- Components (`.jsx` files) - React components
- Node definitions (`components/nodes/*.js`)
- Partial services (nodeExecutionService.js, schedulerService.js, workflowManagerService.js)

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
2. **Better IDE Support**: Improved autocomplete and refactoring
3. **Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code
5. **Test Reliability**: Fixed environment-specific issues

## Migration Guidelines for Future Work

### When migrating a JavaScript file to TypeScript:
1. Start with `.js` → `.ts` or `.jsx` → `.tsx` rename
2. Add type annotations incrementally
3. Fix import paths (remove `.js` extensions)
4. Create interfaces for complex objects
5. Use generic types for reusable functions
6. Test thoroughly in both dev and test environments

### Best Practices:
- Keep types in `src/types/index.ts` for shared interfaces
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when type is truly unknown
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments
- Ensure Node.js compatibility for test environment

## Commands
```bash
# Type checking
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Development server
pnpm dev

# Lint with TypeScript rules
pnpm lint
```
